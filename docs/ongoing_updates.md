# Update to ScenarioPositions
I updated this model to have period_end_date. 
period_end_date will be calculated on the fly when running stress test on portfolio positions 
across multiple periods. Period number and period length in years will be used to calculate period_end_date 
and the record will be saved with calculated period_end_date
